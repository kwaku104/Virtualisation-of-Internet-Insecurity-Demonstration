# Virtualisation of Internet Insecurity Demonstration
This project is to investigate security weaknesses in internet protocols and demonstrate them in a virtualised environment using Kathara.

This is done by demonstrating the Man-In-The-Middle attack using
BGP prefix hijacking in the virtualised environment.

A Python program that extracts the network topology and router configuration created in Kathara, and outputs a graph with the resulting routing paths overlaid on top of the network topology was developed.

The impact of the attack is analysed at real-time at a network level, and the effectiveness of prefix filters to prevent or recover from the attack is analysed as well.
